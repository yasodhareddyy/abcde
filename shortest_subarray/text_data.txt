In this example, we will demonstrate the functionality using a provided text data.
This is a Python program that finds the shortest subarray containing words.
The program will return the start and end indices of the subarray, or a message if no such subarray exists.
You can modify the word list to search for different words within the text.
Feel free to customize the program for your specific needs.
